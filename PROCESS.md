# Development Process

1. Your team must meet in person at least once to determine your implementation plan, assign roles, and decide on communication method. This information should be included in your README.md file.

2. Meeting more than once is highly encouraged, but not required. After the first meeting, your team can choose to meet periodically, either in person or virtually (e.g. conference call, instant messaging), for status updates, merging, etc.

3. Meeting structure can be casual and tailored towards the current needs of the project.

4. Aside from formal meetings, your team should be in constant communication throughout the process, using whatever tool you decide on (e.g. Facebook group, GroupMe, Slack, email). Through this tool, team members can ask questions and update the team on their progress.

5. Progress should be tracked formally through the Git repository and informally on whatever communication tool the team uses. Every commit should have a detailed commit message, and when significant changes are pushed to the repository, the other team members should be notified via the informal channel.

6. Your team may decide how to break down the work into different units. Maybe one person is a rockstar with HTML and CSS and wants to take care of all the front end development. Then maybe the second person writes the JavaScript code for the functionality, and the third person writes all the tests. This is just an example. Whatever your team decides on should be documented in the README.md file.

7. The Git repository should be structured in the same way that the rest of our assignments have been structured. There should be a master branch that contains the most up-to-date, stable version of the codebase. Then each person should create a new branch whenever he or she works on a new feature/addition. When the addition is ready to be added to master, he or she should create a pull request (comparing to master), and ask for someone to review and merge it in. After another team member reviews and approves the code, it can be merged into master.

8. Standards for testing must be determined by the team and documented in the README.md file. It is recommended that a Mocha framework be used for testing the main JavaScript functionality, but this is not a requirement.

9. If a team member is struggling, he should ask for help. Team members who clearly are not pulling their weight will lose points, as described in the Teamwork section of the Grading Standard. Team members who have to do extra work because other team members aren't pulling their weight might receive extra credit. This will be determined by the feedback that the grader receives in the final emails.

10. Non-responsive team members will be handled in the same way that non-contributing team members are handled, as described in #9.

11. All documentation (aside from commit messages and pull requests) should be included in the README.md file. This includes your team's implementation plan, code structure, roles, communication method, meeting schedule, testing standards, bug tracking method, and any other information that is pertinent to the project.

12. Your team can choose how to track bugs, but this must be documented in the README.md file. It is recommended that you use Git's issue tracking system, but this is not a requirement.

13. The customer/user will be available during the initial meeting (either in person or virtually) to ensure that the development team is clear on the expectations for the project and there is no confusion on any of the specifications. After that, you may contact the customer via email with any further questions.

14. Standard coding practices should be used during the implementation of the project (modularity, reduced duplication, good commenting and variable names, etc.). This is what will your team will be graded on for the Style section of the Grading Standard.

15. Change requests regarding scope are not allowed after the initial meeting. The user/customer (I) will be available during this meeting, so make sure to clear up any confusion before it is over.

16. Adherence to the process will be measured in three ways: (1) Examination of your team's README.md file; (2) Examination of your team's activity on the Git repository; (3) Review of individual team member feedback in final emails.
